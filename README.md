# UHM Hotfix

UHM Hotfix is a web application that allows students to report suggestions or problems they find on campus in ten seconds or less. 

## Introduction

University of Hawai ªi at Manoa is <b>our</b> campus. We all deserve a campus that is safe, clean, and beautiful. With UHM Hotfix, students make suggestions and report problems found on campus near-instantly using their laptops or smartphones. UHM Hotfix will encourage and empower students to take an active approach to improving our campus, so that we all can have a more enjoyable college experience.

# Next Steps

The team will first focus on both creating the static web pages that will make up the site, and designing and implementing the database schema. Once this is completed, we will integrate the database with the static user interface. Finally, we will add the finishing touches by implementing the use of geolocation using the google maps api, and creating the new issue stream.
