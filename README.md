# UHM Hotfix

## The Problem
Students notice problems with facilities, landscaping, lighting, as well as opportunities for improvement to the UHM campus all the time. While there is a campus hotline number that students could call to report these problems, this is old fashioned, time consuming, and feels like talking into a “black hole”. For all these reasons, students won’t typically use it.

## The Solution
Design a web app that, once a student logs in once, allows them to report a problem or enhancement idea in less than 10 seconds of effort. The page would have a pull-down list of possible problem types, the urgency of the request, the location, and a short field with which the student can provide a description.
